# Web App built in React for booking an SF-based Balloon Artist

### Kevin's Balloons 
This is a booking form, built in React and Formik, that allows users to book me for their events. 

There are 6 pages, dividing the information up into related groups. Eventually, I'll move the Personal Information section to the front, to capture contact info, so if someone doesn't complete the form, I can send them an email reminding them to finish. 

The dots along the bottom provide navigation through the form, along with helping users see their progress. 

Currently, I'm still working on getting the form validation working, and then I'll have to figure out how to store the information users provide on submit, while also linking to the next view.
